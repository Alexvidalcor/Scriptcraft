# Add Music Metadata from File and Folder Names

This Python script allows you to automatically add metadata to your music files using information contained in file and folder names. This can be useful when you have a large, disorganized music collection and want to efficiently organize and tag it.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. The script uses the [Mutagen](https://mutagen.readthedocs.io/) library to work with music files, so you'll need to have it installed as well. You can install Mutagen using pip:

```bash
pip install mutagen
